Brainy Phonics Web is a web-based application designed to teach the alphabet and phonics to children from Pre-Kindergarten to 6th grade, targeted to be housed on the website hearatale.org.

This project was conducted in a team of 5, under the request of our client, Dr. Walter Evans, as a Junior-Design project at Georgia Institute of Technology.
The primary goal for this project was developing an intuitive and consistent design that mimics the learning experience and user flow of the existing iOS and Android Brainy Phonics mobile application.

I took part in the front-end development, focusing on mimicking the UI/UX from the iOS/Android applications and improving user experience.
