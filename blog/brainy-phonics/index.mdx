Brainy Phonics Web is a web-based application designed to teach the alphabet and phonics to children from Pre-Kindergarten to 6th grade, targeted to be housed on the website hearatale.org.

The application features 94 phonemes and 26 alphabet letters with examples and quizzes to assess users' learning.

This project was conducted in a team of 5, under the request of our client, Dr. Walter Evans, as a Junior-Design project at Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr. Evans aimed to create this educational application across different devices over the years through the aid of Georgia Tech's students, so as a result, there was an existing iOS and Android application for our project, but the source codes weren't directly reusable.

Therefore, one of our primary goals was developing an intuitive and consistent design that mimics the learning experience and user flow of these applications.

I took part in the front-end development of the application, focusing on mimicking the UI/UX from the iOS/Android applications and improving user experience.
