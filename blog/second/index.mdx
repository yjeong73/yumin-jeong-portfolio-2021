* Front-end Developer
* Worked in a team of 5 and our client Dr. Walter Evans to build a web-based application housed on hearatale.org, designed to teach the alphabet and phonics to elementary children
* Focused on front-end development, UI/UX
* Was able to obtain experience with Angular 8, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Brainy Phonics Web is a web-based application designed to teach the alphabet and phonics to children from
Pre-Kindergarten to 6th grade. The application will be housed on the website hearatale.org
and feature 94 phonemes and 26 alphabet letters with examples and quizzes to assess
users' learning. Because there is an existing iOS and Android application for our project,
one of our primary goals was developing an intuitive and consistent design that mimics the
learning experience and user flow of these applications. Dr. Walter Evans was our client.
