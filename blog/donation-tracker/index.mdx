Donation Tracker is a mobile Android application that was designed to help non-profit organizations track donations of goods for Georgia Tech’s CS+ Social Good, an organization that focuses on the intersection of computer science and social impact.

The project was conducted under Georgia Tech's professor Bob Waters, where multiple teams of 5 students all aimed to create an application with the same goal.

Our mission was to create an internal resource planning app for non-profit donation focused organizations (e.g. Goodwill, Lost-nfound Youth) to efficiently track and categorize donations.

The project was written in Java using Android Studio, and I worked mostly on functionality because most of the front-end development, UI/UX, was just constructed through the Layout Editor in Android Studio instead of writing layout XML by hand. Overall, this project allowed me to solidify my experience with Java.
