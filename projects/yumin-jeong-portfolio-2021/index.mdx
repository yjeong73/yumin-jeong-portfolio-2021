This is a personal portfolio website, or an interactive resume, that I have created using JavaScript, CSS, React, and Gatsby.

<p style="font-family:Yeseva One, cursive; font-size:3.5vh">About</p>
I have created this website to gain more experience with front-end development and challenge my artistic abilities.
