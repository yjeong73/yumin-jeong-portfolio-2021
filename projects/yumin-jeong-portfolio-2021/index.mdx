This is a personal portfolio website that I have created using JavaScript, CSS, React, and Gatsby.

<p style="font-family:Yeseva One, cursive; font-size:3.5vh">About</p>
The purpose for this website was to gain more experience with front-end development and showcase my abilities. This website is currently optimized for PC web browsers, and it is not quite workable with the mobile version. I am aiming to make minor updates and optimize for mobile browsers too in the near future.
